# Gaubao

[Guabao](https://scmlab.github.io/guabao/) is a programming environment encouraging the methodology that a program and its correctness proof should be developed hand in hand, and that how a program should be proved could sometimes give hints how the program can be written.

For more info, see the [project page](https://scmlab.github.io/guabao/).
